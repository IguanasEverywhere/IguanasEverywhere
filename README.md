## Hi, Everyone! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github Portfolio!

â™«  I currently work in the software industry, combining years of development experience with the attention to detail and perseverance gained through work in the classical music industry

â™«  I love working with JavaScript, Python, React, Vue, and a number of libraries and frameworks

â™«  After years as a music faculty member in higher education, I am particularly passionate about developing solutions for artists and EdTech

<details>
  <summary>About Me</summary>
  
  Full stack developer with a passion for solving problems and diving deep! The discipline and tenacity gained from years as 
  a professional pianist ðŸŽ¹ and college faculty member uniquely primed me for my career in the software industry.
  
  ### My Values
  - Life-long learning; a week where I haven't discovered something new or honed a new skill feels incomplete
  - User-centered software: if we're not developing with the user needs/experience in mind, the game is already lost
  - Clear, empathic and helpful communication. I love to work on a team, providing help to and learning from others!
